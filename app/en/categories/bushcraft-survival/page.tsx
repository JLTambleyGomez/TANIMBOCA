                        Jungle Bushcraft and Survival is all about learning to survive by adapting to natureâ€”whether for the thrill of adventure or in real emergency situations.
                        Your journey begins with an extended trek deep into the rainforest, where we establish a basecamp. The site is carefully chosen near a creek, the perfect place to set up hammocks equipped with mosquito nets and tarps. From this base, over the following days, you will gain skills through direct, hands-on experience.
                        Our native guides, from diverse ethnic groups, will teach you how to build simple yet highly effective shelters, practice traditional fishing techniques in creeks and rivers, set traps for fish, mammals, and birds, navigate using the sun, and craft tools for fishing and huntingâ€”along with many other skills that naturally emerge along the way.

                        <strong>Day 1 - Arrival and Canopy Adventure:</strong>
                        Touch down in Leticia at VÃ¡squez Cobo Airport, where your adventure begins. A short 11 km drive takes you to the Tanimboca Natural Reserve, your gateway to the Amazon. After a warm welcome, check-in, and orientation, we head to La Arenosa to enjoy a traditional Amazonian lunch of freshly grilled fish.
                        In the afternoon, step right into the treetops with an exhilarating canopy experience. Climb by rope to the first platform, then soar between three observation points on zip lines, and cross a hanging bridge suspended high above the forest floor. The final descent is a thrilling rappel back to solid ground.
                        Your accommodation tonight will be truly unique: a treehouse perched in the jungle canopy or a rustic cabin by a creek (subject to availability). After a short rest, join your guide for a night walk, where the rainforest reveals its hidden nocturnal life. Dinner is served back at the reserveâ€”a special Amazon-style pizza or other local dishesâ€”before you drift off to sleep to the symphony of the jungle.

                        <strong>Day 2 - Preparing for the Expedition</strong>
                        Fuel up with breakfast, then head into Leticia for any last-minute gear or supplies. Weâ€™ll enjoy lunch at a local restaurant before returning to Tanimboca.
                        In the afternoon, we gather for a hands-on expedition briefing. Youâ€™ll learn essential jungle skills, including a basic introduction to machete use and safety. Afterwards, youâ€™ll begin sorting and preparing the gear for the days ahead. The excitement buildsâ€”tomorrow, the real expedition begins.

                        <strong>Day 3 - Into the Jungle:</strong>
                        After breakfast, we set out on foot into the heart of the Amazon. A couple of hours of trekking brings us to a pristine creek, where we establish our base camp.
                        For the next seven days, this camp becomes much more than shelterâ€”it is your home in the wild and your open-air classroom. Here, youâ€™ll live immersed in the rainforest, learning its rhythms, discovering its secrets, and building a bond with this extraordinary environment. By the time we leave, youâ€™ll feel a deep connection to the placeâ€”and youâ€™ll miss it the moment we turn back toward civilization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Day 9 - Back to Civilization:</strong>
                        We take down camp and begin the trek back to Tanimboca Reserve. After a hearty lunch, weâ€™ll head into town for a well-deserved cold drink or ice cream and some time to browse local handicrafts.
                        In the late afternoon, get ready for one of the Amazonâ€™s most unforgettable spectacles: thousands of parrots swirling back to their roosts in Leticiaâ€™s main square at sunset. Itâ€™s the perfect reminder of the jungleâ€™s wild beauty before returning to Tanimboca for the night.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Day 10 - Amazon River Exploration:</strong>Today we trade boots for boats and explore the mighty Amazon River. Weâ€™ll visit Monkey Island, then set out in search of the elusive pink river dolphins.
                        Lunch is served at a floating restaurant on the riverâ€”an experience in itself. In the afternoon, we return to Tanimboca and close the expedition with a festive Amazonian barbecue and caipirinhas, sharing stories under the stars.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Day 11 - Farewell:</strong>Depending on your flight schedule, weâ€™ll transfer you to the airport and assist with check-in.
                        End of Tour â€“ but the Amazon will stay with you forever.
