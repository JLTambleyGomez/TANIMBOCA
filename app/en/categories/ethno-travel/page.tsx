          <strong>Ethno Travel</strong> is much more than a journey: it is an{" "}
          <em>authentic encounter with cultural diversity</em>. This type of
          tourism invites you to live with indigenous communities, sharing their
          traditions, languages, handicrafts, gastronomy, and unique worldview.
          Unlike conventional tourism, it is based on respect, participation,
          and mutual benefit. Each experience strengthens cultural identity,
          promotes sustainable development, and offers travelers the opportunity
          to discover the world through the eyes of native peoples.

          <p>
            We organize immersive experiences with indigenous communities near
            Leticia, where visitors can share directly with families and learn
            from their ancestral knowledge. Through craft workshops, guided
            walks, and moments of dialogue, travelers have the opportunity to
            experience culture from the inside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Activities include cooking traditional dishes, learning local
            crafts, canoeing, participating in rituals, and exploring the
            rainforest alongside community members. Lodging is provided in
            eco-lodges or within community homes, respecting daily life
            rhythms.

          <p>
            We also offer expeditions to the Brazilian side, in the Yavar√≠ River
            valley ‚Äî home of the Matis communities. The Matis first came into
            contact with the outside world in 1975. A few years later, diseases
            introduced by outsiders reduced their population to fewer than 100
            survivors, mostly children and young people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, the Matis are a joyful and thriving people, with around 600
            members living in five communities. During the expedition, we spend
            five days with several Matis families in a jungle hunting camp,
            about eight hours by boat from Leticia. This unique journey allows
            travelers to experience their culture and way of life up close.
