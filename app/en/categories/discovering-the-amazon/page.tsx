                        <strong>Day 1:</strong> Arrive in Leticia at VÃ¡squez Cobo Airport, followed by an 11 km land transfer to the Tanimboca Natural Reserve. After a warm welcome, check-in, and a briefing on your itinerary, youâ€™ll head to La Arenosa to enjoy a traditional Amazonian lunch featuring freshly grilled fish.
                        In the afternoon, take a short jungle walk to reach the canopy platformsâ€”an exciting yet safe treetop adventure. Youâ€™ll climb to the first platform by rope, then glide between three observation points via zip lines and cross a hanging bridge suspended high in the forest canopy. The final descent is done by rappel.
                        After your canopy experience, your guide will accompany you to your accommodation for the nightâ€”either a treehouse or a jungle-edge cabin by a creek (depending on availability). Following a short rest, embark on a guided night walk to discover the rainforestâ€™s nocturnal sounds and creatures. Dinner will be a special Amazonian-style pizza or other menu options served at our restaurant, followed by a peaceful night surrounded by the sounds of the jungle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Day 2:</strong> After breakfast, begin a guided walk through the jungle. Along the way, your guide will introduce you to medicinal plants, natural construction materials, vines used for basket weaving, and other native resources.
                        The walk concludes at Reserva Natural Selva, where lunch is served in a Malocaâ€”a traditional communal house normally used by Indigenous communities. Later, visit a Chagraâ€”a traditional Amazonian gardenâ€”where crops such as yuca, chili peppers, plantains, bananas, and coca are cultivated.
                        In the afternoon, participate in a hands-on Mambe preparation workshop, where youâ€™ll process coca leaves and learn about their ancestral uses and cultural significance. Return to Tanimboca Reserve to relax by the natural creek before spending the night in a comfortable jungle bungalow.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Day 3:</strong> After an early breakfast, head to the Leticia harbor and board a boat along the Amazon River to a stunning Peruvian Natural Reserve. Depending on the season, access is either a 45-minute jungle walk (dry season) or a peaceful canoe ride (rainy season).
                        This reserve is rich in biodiversityâ€”you may spot monkeys, exotic birds, and other wildlife. Enjoy freshly prepared local meals and explore the forest on foot or by canoe. Keep an eye out for giant lotus flowers and the towering Ceiba trees.
                        After nightfall, join a guided excursion in search of caimansâ€”a thrilling yet safe adventure. Overnight stay in the Peruvian reserve.

                        <strong>Day 4:</strong> In the morning, travel by private boat 80 km upriver to Puerto NariÃ±o, stopping at Monkey Island and Macedonia, an Indigenous community renowned for its intricate wood carving and handicrafts.
                        Upon arrival in Puerto NariÃ±oâ€”a peaceful, car-free village on the Loretoyacu Riverâ€”youâ€™ll have lunch, then visit the Natutama Foundation, a local initiative that educates visitors about the rich underwater life of the Amazon.
                        In the afternoon, return to Leticia and witness an unforgettable natural spectacle: thousands of parrots returning to their roosting trees in the main square at sunset. The night you spend in Leticia at a hotel.

                    <p>
